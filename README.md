## System Implementation Guide

To deploy the DJR Tenda Salary Management System, please follow the steps outlined below.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Clone the project source code to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/djrtenda/web
    cd djr-tenda-system
    ```

2.  **Configure Firebase**
    * Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    * Enable **Firestore** and **Firebase Authentication** (with the Email/Password provider).
    * In your project settings, find your Firebase configuration object.
    * Create a file named `firebase-config.js` in the root directory and paste your configuration:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
        };
        firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        const auth = firebase.auth();
        const db = firebase.firestore();
        ```

3.  **Establish User Roles in Firestore**
    * Manually add users in the Firebase Authentication tab.
    * In Firestore, create a `users` collection.
    * For each user, create a document with their UID as the document ID. The document must contain a `role` field (`admin` or `employee`) and a `name` field.

4.  **Launch the Application**
    * Use a local development server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) to open `index.html`.
    * Log in with the credentials created in Firebase.
